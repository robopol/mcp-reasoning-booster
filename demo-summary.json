Albert: \"Now I also know.\"\n\n We need to find the exact date.\n\n Approach:\n\n Step 1: Albert says he doesn't know and that Bernard doesn't know either.\n   - Why Albert doesn't know? Because the month he has has more than one possible day.\n   - Why he knows Bernard doesn't know? Because for the month Albert has, every day in that month appears in more than one month (so Bernard, having that day, wouldn't be able to tell the month).\n\n How to verify step 1:\n   - List the days that are unique (appearing only once): \n        18 (only in June), 19 (only in May) -> so if Bernard had 18 or 19, he would know the date.\n   - Therefore, Albert's month cannot be May or June because:\n        May has 19 (unique) and June has 18 (unique). \n        But Albert says he knows Bernard doesn't know -> so the month must not have any unique day.\n   - So we eliminate May and June? Actually, note: \n        May: 15,16,19 -> 19 is unique -> so if Albert had May, he couldn't be sure Bernard doesn't know (because if Bernard got 19, he would know). \n        Similarly, June: 17,18 -> 18 is unique -> same problem.\n        July: 14,16 -> 14 appears in August too, 16 appears in May too -> so no unique day in July? \n            But wait: 14 appears in July and August -> not unique; 16 appears in May and July -> not unique.\n        August: 14,15,17 -> 14 (July, Aug), 15 (May, Aug), 17 (June, Aug) -> none unique.\n\n   However, note that Albert says \"I know that Bernard doesn't know\". So for Albert's month, every day in that month must be non-unique (i.e., appear in at least two months).\n\n   Therefore, we can eliminate months that contain a day that is unique in the entire list.\n\n   Unique days: \n        18 -> only June\n        19 -> only May\n        So May and June are eliminated because they contain a unique day (19 and 18 respectively).\n\n   Remaining months: July, August.\n\n   Expected outcomes: \n        - Eliminate May and June.\n        - Remaining dates: July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17.\n\n Step 2: Bernard, after hearing Albert, now knows the date.\n   - Bernard knows the day. He also now knows that the month is either July or August (because Albert's statement eliminated May and June).\n   - So Bernard can look at his day and see in which of the remaining months (July, August) that day appears.\n\n   How to verify step 2:\n        - For each day in the remaining dates:\n            Day 14: appears in July and August -> if Bernard had 14, he wouldn't know which month (July or August) -> so he wouldn't know the date",

Albert: \"I don't know the date, and I know that Bernard doesn't know either.\"\n    - This implies that the month Albert has does not contain a unique day (because if it did, Bernard might know if he had that unique day). \n    - Unique days in the list: \n        14: appears in July and August -> not unique\n        15: May, August -> not unique\n        16: May, July -> not unique\n        17: June, August -> not unique\n        18: only June -> unique\n        19: only May -> unique\n    - So, if Albert had May, he would see that May has 19 (unique) so Bernard might know (if Bernard had 19).

Bernard: \"Now I know the date.\"\n    - Bernard, knowing the day, and now knowing that the month is either July or August, can figure out the exact date.\n    - So, the day Bernard has must be unique in the remaining months (July and August). \n    - Days in July and August: \n        July: 14, 16\n        August: 14, 15, 17\n    - Days that appear only once in these two months: \n        14: appears in both July and August -> not unique\n        15: only in August -> unique\n        16: only in July -> unique\n        17: only in August -> unique\n    - Therefore, if Bernard had 14, he wouldn't know (because it could be July 14 or August 14).

But we know the day is not 14 (from Bernard's statement), so it must be July 16. \n    - If Albert had August, then the possible dates are August 14, 15, 17. Without 14, we have 15 and 17. So Albert wouldn't be able to distinguish between August 15 and 17.\n    - Therefore, Albert must have July (so he can say he knows) because if he had August he would still have two options.\n\n Hence, the date is July 16.\n\n However, we are to generate 5 actionable micro-steps (but the problem says return 7 steps).

Because if Albert had a month with a unique day (like May 19 or June 18, which are the only days 19 and 18), then Bernard might know. But Albert says Bernard doesn't know, so the month cannot be May or June? Actually, let's see:\n\n   The days that are unique in the entire list are 18 and 19 (because 18 only appears in June, 19 only in May). So if Bernard had 18 or 19, he would know immediately. But Albert says Bernard doesn't know, meaning that the month Albert has does not contain 18 or 19. Therefore, we can eliminate May and June? Not exactly: because May has 19 (which is unique) and June has 18 (unique). So if Albert had May, he would think: \"if the day is 19, Bernard would know\". But Albert says Bernard doesn't know, so Albert must be sure that the day is not 19 (for May) or 18 (for June). Therefore, the month cannot be May or June? Actually, no: because May also has 15 and 16, which are not unique. So Albert, if he had May, would not be sure: because if the day is 19, Bernard would know, but if it's 15 or 16, Bernard wouldn't. But Albert says \"I know that Bernard doesn't know\", meaning that for the month Albert has, every day in that month appears in more than one month. So:\n\n   - May: 15 (also in Aug), 16 (also in July), 19 (only in May) -> so if the day was 19, Bernard would know. Therefore, Albert cannot have May because he wouldn't be sure Bernard doesn't know (if it were 19, Bernard would know).\n   - June: 17 (also in Aug), 18 (only in June) -> same issue: if it were 18, Bernard would know.

Because if Albert had a month with a unique day (like May 19 or June 18, which are the only days 19 and 18), then Bernard might know. But Albert says he knows Bernard doesn't know. So the month cannot have a day that is unique in the entire list.\n\n    How to verify: \n      - List all days and see which days appear only once: \n          14: appears in July and August -> not unique\n          15: appears in May and August -> not unique\n          16: appears in May and July -> not unique\n          17: appears in June and August -> not unique\n          18: only in June -> unique\n          19: only in May -> unique\n\n      Therefore, if Albert had May, he would see that May has 19 (unique) so Bernard might know (if it were 19).

Expected outcomes: unique days (18,19) and non-unique (14,15,16,17).\n\n Step 2: Albert says he knows Bernard doesn't know. So the month Albert has cannot have any unique day (because if it did, Bernard might have known). Therefore, eliminate months that contain a unique day (May has 19, June has 18 -> so May and June are out? But wait, Albert says he doesn't know and also that Bernard doesn't know. So the month must be one that has no unique day? Actually, the unique days are 18 and 19. So if Albert had May, he would see that May has 19 (which is unique) and then Bernard might have 19 and know. But Albert says he knows Bernard doesn't know, so Albert's month cannot have a unique day. Therefore, May and June are eliminated because they have 19 and 18 respectively.\n\n However, note: Albert says \"I don't know\" (which is true for any month with more than one date) and \"I know that Bernard doesn't know\". So for Albert to be sure Bernard doesn't know, his month must not contain any day that is unique in the entire list.\n\n Step 3: After Albert's statement, Bernard now knows. So Bernard, who knows the day, can eliminate May and June. Then with the remaining dates (July and August), he can figure out the date. That means the day Bernard has must be unique in the remaining set (July and August). The remaining days: July 14,16; August 14,15,17. So days: 14 (appears twice), 15 (once), 16 (once), 17 (once). Therefore, if Bernard had 14, he wouldn't know (because it appears in both July and August). But he now knows, so the day cannot be 14. So the possible dates become: July 16, August 15, August 17.\n\n Step 4: Then Albert says he now knows. Albert knows the month. If the month were August, there are two dates (",

Therefore, Albert must have a month that does not contain 18 or 19? \n     - Actually, Albert knows the month. If the month were May, then the possible days are 15,16,19.

Unique days are those that appear only once (e.g., 18, 19).

Therefore, Albert must have a month that has no unique day.\n\n Step 4: After Albert's statement, Bernard now knows. So Bernard, who knows the day, can eliminate some months. He now knows the birthday, meaning that with the day he has, and knowing that the month is not May or June (from step 3), there is only one possibility.\n\n Step 5: Then Albert, knowing the month and hearing Bernard now knows, can figure it out.

Because the month that Albert has does not contain a unique day (i.e., a day that appears only once in the entire list). \n   - Unique days: 18 (only in June), 19 (only in May). So if Albert had May or June, he couldn't be sure that Bernard doesn't know (because if Bernard had 19, he would know it's May 19; similarly 18 for June 18). \n   - Therefore, Albert must have a month that does not include 18 or 19. So we eliminate May and June.\n\n Step 2: After Albert's statement, Bernard now knows the date. \n   - Bernard, who knows the day, can now deduce the month. \n   - The remaining dates are: July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17.\n   - Bernard knows the day. If the day were 14, then Bernard would still have two options (July 14 and August 14) and wouldn't know. But Bernard says he now knows. Therefore, the day cannot be 14.\n   - So we eliminate 14. Remaining: July 16, August 15, August 17.\n\n Step 3: Now Albert, who knows the month, says he also knows. \n   - If Albert had August, he would have two dates (15 and 17) and wouldn't know which one. But he says he knows. Therefore, the month must be July (only one date left: July 16).\n\n However, we are to break this into 7 micro-steps that are verifiable.\n\n Let's design 7 steps:\n\n Step 1: Identify days that are unique in the entire list (appearing only once). \n   - How to verify: Count frequency of each day (14,15,16,17,18,19). \n   - Expected outcomes: Unique days are 18 and 19 (each appears once).\n\n Step 2: Albert's first statement implies his month has no unique day. \n   - How to verify: Check which months contain unique days (May has 19, June has 18). \n   - Expected outcomes: Months with unique days (May, June) are eliminated; remaining months: July, August.\n\n Step 3: After Albert's statement, Bernard now knows the date. \n   - How to verify: For each day in the remaining dates (July 14,16; Aug 14,15,17), check if",

So Albert must have July or August.\n\n Expected outcomes: \n   - Months eliminated: May, June\n   - Remaining months: July, August\n\n Step 2: After Albert's statement, Bernard now knows the birthday. Bernard knows the day and now knows the month is either July or August. So the day must be unique in the remaining set (July and August).\n\n How to verify: Look at the days in July and August: \n   July: 14, 16\n   August: 14, 15, 17\n   Days: 14 (appears twice), 15 (once), 16 (once), 17 (once). \n   But Bernard now knows, so his day must be one that appears only once in the remaining set (i.e., 15, 16, 17). Therefore, 14 is eliminated because it appears in both July and August.\n\n Expected outcomes:\n   - Eliminate dates with day 14 (July 14, August 14)\n   - Remaining dates: July 16, August 15, August 17\n\n Step 3: Now Albert says he also knows. Albert knows the month. If the month were August, there are two dates (15 and 17) so he wouldn't know. But if the month is July, there is only one date (July 16). Therefore, it must be July 16.\n\n How to verify: Check the remaining dates by month:\n   July: [16] -> only one\n   August: [15,17] -> two\n   So Albert, knowing the month, can only know the date if the month is July.\n\n Expected outcomes:\n   - The date is July 16.\n\n However, note that the puzzle is classic and the answer is July 16. But we must generate 7 steps.\n\n We break down the reasoning into 7 micro-steps:\n\n Step 1: List all unique days (18,19) because they would let Bernard know immediately.\n   How_to_verify: Count frequency of each day: 14(2),15(2),16(2),17(2),18(1),19(1). Unique days: 18,19.\n   Expected_outcomes: [\"Days 1",

If the month had a unique day (like May 19 or June 18, which are the only ones with 19 and 18 respectively), then Bernard might know. But Albert says Bernard doesn't know, so the month cannot be May or June? Actually, let's see:\n\n   The days that are unique in the entire list are 18 and 19 (because 18 only appears in June, 19 only in May). So if Bernard had 18 or 19, he would know immediately. But Albert says Bernard doesn't know, meaning that the month Albert has does not contain 18 or 19. Therefore, we can eliminate May and June? Wait, but note: May has 19 (which is unique) and June has 18 (unique). So if Albert had May, he would think: \"if the day is 19, Bernard would know\". Similarly for June. But Albert is sure that Bernard doesn't know, so the month cannot be May or June because they have unique days. Therefore, the month must be July or August.\n\n   However, note that July and August both have 14, which is not unique (appears in both July and August). Also, July has 16 (which also appears in May) and August has 15 and 17 (which also appear in May and June respectively? Actually, 15 appears in May and August, 17 in June and August). So the unique days are only 18 and 19.\n\n   Therefore, after Albert's first statement, we eliminate May and June. So the possible dates become:\n      July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17.\n\n Step 2: Bernard says \"Now I know\".\n   - Bernard, who knows the day, now can figure out the date.

He says he doesn't know (which is obvious because each month has multiple days) and that he knows Bernard doesn't know. This means that the month Albert has cannot contain a unique day (because if the day was unique, Bernard would know immediately). So we eliminate months that have a day that appears only once in the entire list.\n\n How to verify: Check the list of days and see which days are unique. Unique days: 18 (only in June), 19 (only in May). Therefore, if Albert had May or June, he couldn't be sure Bernard doesn't know (because if the day was 19, Bernard would know for May; if 18, for June). So Albert must have a month without unique days -> July or August.\n\n Expected outcomes: Eliminate May and June. Remaining dates: July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, August 17.\n\n Step 2: Bernard, after hearing Albert, now knows the birthday. Bernard knows the day. So for the day he has, there must be only one possible month left in the remaining dates (from step 1). Check the days in the remaining set: \n   14: appears in July and August -> two options\n   15: only in August\n   16: only in July\n   17: only in August\n\n But note: Bernard says \"now I know\", meaning that with the information that the month is either July or August, his day must uniquely determine the month. Therefore, if Bernard had 14, he would still have two months (July and August) and wouldn't know. So 14 is eliminated.\n\n How to verify: For each day in the remaining set (14,15,16,17), count the number of months. Days 15,16,17 each appear once; day 14 appears twice.

However, the task says \"Give 5 actionable micro-steps\" but then says \"Return 7 steps\". \n Since the problem says \"Return 7 steps\", we will generate 7 steps.\n\n Constraints:\n  - Each step <= 200 characters.\n  - Include \"how_to_verify\" as a concrete check.\n  - Suggest 2-4 expected outcomes when natural.\n  - Avoid meta phrases.\n  - Propose alternatives rather than repeats of recent steps.\n\n We are to output as a JSON array of 7 objects, each with:\n   \"text\": the step description (<=200 chars)\n   \"rationale\": why this step (<=200 chars)\n   \"how_to_verify\": concrete check (<=200 chars)\n   \"expected_outcomes\": array of 2-4 strings\n\n Alternatively, if JSON is inconvenient, a bullet list with labels. But the problem says JSON preferred.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Generate small, local, verifiable next steps for the task.\" and we are to avoid repeating recent steps (2,3,4).\n\n Let's think of the puzzle:\n\n Step 1: Albert says he doesn't know and that Bernard doesn't know either.\n   - Why? Because if Albert had a month with a unique day (like May 19 or June 18, which are the only ones with 19 and 18), then Bernard might know. But Albert says Bernard doesn't know, so the month cannot have a day that is unique in the entire list.\n\n How to break it down:\n\n We can create steps that:\n\n 1. Identify days that appear only once (unique days) because if Bernard had one of those, he would know immediately.\n    - Unique days: 18 (only June 18), 19 (only May 19). Also, 14 appears twice (July and August), 15 twice (May and August), 16 twice (May and July), 17 twice (June and August).\n\n 2. Albert says he knows Bernard doesn't know. That means the month Albert has cannot contain any unique day (because if it did, Bernard might have that unique day and know). So we eliminate months that have a unique day.\n\n    - May has 19 (unique) -> so if Albert had May, he couldn't be sure Bernard doesn't know (because if Bernard had 19, he would know). So May is eliminated.\n    - June has 18 (unique) -> similarly, June is eliminated.\n    - July: days 14 and 16 -> both non-unique? 14 appears in August too, 16 appears in May too -> so non-unique. So July is possible.\n    - August: days 14,15,17 ->",
