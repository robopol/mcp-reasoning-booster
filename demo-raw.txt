We are solving the classic water jug puzzle: we have a 3-liter jug and a 5-liter jug, and we need to measure exactly 4 liters.
 Recent steps and hints suggest we should focus on concrete actions, verifiable checks, and avoid repeating recent steps.

 We are to output exactly 7 steps in the specified JSON array format (or bullet list if JSON is inconvenient, but we'll do JSON as requested).

 Constraints:
 - Each step <= 200 characters.
 - How_to_verify: concrete check (e.g., "Check jug A has 2L by pouring into measuring cup").
 - Expected_outcomes: 2-4 outcomes (e.g., ["jug full", "jug not full"]).
 - Avoid meta phrases; propose alternatives.

 Recent steps (3,4,5) were about comparing alternatives, designing experiments, and checking constraints. We should avoid repeating those exact approaches.

 We are to generate 7 steps. The last step should be a "Final step" if we can get the answer.

 Let's plan the steps:

 Step 1: Fill the 5L jug completely. (Standard first step)
 Step 2: Pour from 5L jug into 3L jug until 3L is full. Now 5L has 2L left.
 Step 3: Empty the 3L jug.
 Step 4: Pour the remaining 2L from 5L jug into 3L jug.
 Step 5: Fill the 5L jug again.
 Step 6: Pour from 5L jug into 3L jug (which already has 2L) until 3L is full. This takes 1L, leaving 4L in 5L jug.
 Step 7: Final step: We have 4L in the 5L jug. Verify by checking the 5L jug has 4L (by pouring into a measuring container or by knowing the capacity).

 However, note the hints: we should avoid repeating recent steps (which were about comparing alternatives, etc.) and we are to generate steps that are small, local, verifiable.

 But the puzzle is deterministic. We must output 7 steps. We can break down the process.

 Important: The problem says "explicit step-by-step actions and checks". So each step must have an action and a check.

 Let's design 7 steps:

 Step 1: Fill the 5L jug to the top. 
   How to verify: The jug overflows or a marked line shows 5L.
   Expected outcomes: ["5L jug full", "5L jug not full"]

 Step 2: Pour water from 5L jug into 3L jug until 3L jug is full.
   How to verify: Stop pouring when 3L jug reaches its brim.
   Expected outcomes: ["3L jug full, 5L jug has 2L", "3L jug not full"]

 Step 3: Empty the 3L jug completely.
   How to verify: Invert 3L jug until no water drips.
   Expected outcomes: ["3L jug empty", "3L jug still has water"]

 Step 4: Pour the remaining 2L from 5L jug into the empty 3L jug.
   How to verify: Pour until 5L jug is empty or 3L jug is full (it will be exactly 2L in 3L jug).
   Expected outcomes: ["3L jug has 2L", "3L jug has less than 2L"]

 Step 5: Fill the 5L jug again to the top.
   How to verify: Same as step 1.
   Expected outcomes: ["5L jug full", "5L jug not full"]

 Step 6: Pour water from 5L jug into 3L jug (which has 2L) until 3L jug is full.
   How to verify: 3L jug can take 1 more liter, so stop when it's full.
   Expected outcomes: ["3L jug full, 5L jug has 4L", "3L jug not full"]

 Step 7: Final step: The 5L jug now contains exactly 4 liters. Verify by pouring the water from 5L jug into a 4L container or by measuring with a scale (but the puzzle typically assumes we can see the level). However, the puzzle doesn't have a 4L container. Alternatively, we can note that 5L - 1L (since we poured 1L to fill the 3L jug) = 4L. But the verification must be concrete.

 How to verify 4L? We can pour the 4L into the 3L jug and see that it fills the 3L jug and leaves 1L in the 5L jug? But that doesn't directly show 4L.

 Actually, the standard solution ends with 4L in the 5L jug. We can verify by:
   - Knowing the capacity of the 5L jug and that we started with 5L and removed 1L (by filling the 3L jug which had 2L, so we added 1L to make it 3L) so 5-1=4.

 But the problem says "explicit step-by-step actions and checks". So we need a physical check.

 Alternative verification: 
   We can pour the 4L from the 5L jug into the 3L jug. The 3L jug will fill completely (3L) and then we have 1L left in the 5L jug. But that doesn't show 4L, it shows 3L and 1L.

 However, the goal is to have 4L in one jug. We have it in the 5L jug. We can verify by:
   - Using a scale: 4L of water weighs 4kg (if we assume density 1kg/L). But the puzzle is usually without scales.

 The puzzle is abstract. The verification step in the puzzle context is by the process: we know we have 4L because we followed the steps.

 But the problem says: "how_to_verify as a concrete check". So we must think of a way.

 Idea: We can pour the 4L from the 5L jug into two 2L containers? But we don't have them.

 Alternatively, we can note that the 5L jug has 4L, so if we fill a 1L container (which we don't have) we could check. 

 However, the problem does not provide additional tools. So the verification is by the process: we know the steps and the capacities.

 But the problem says "concrete check". So we have to rely on the fact that we can see the water level? 

 In reality, without markings, we can't see 4L. But the puzzle assumes we can fill to the brim and empty completely, and we know the capacities.

 Therefore, the verification for step 7 is: 
   "Check that the 5L jug is not full (so less than 5L) and that the 3L jug is empty (so we didn't pour from it). Then, by the process, it must be 4L."

 However, that is not concrete.

 Another idea: We can pour the 4L from the 5L jug into the 3L jug. Then we have 3L in the 3L jug and 1L left in the 5L jug. Then we empty the 3L jug and pour the 1L from the 5L jug into the 3L jug. Then fill the 5L jug and pour from 5L jug into 3L jug (which has 1L) until full (which takes 2L), leaving 3L in the 5L jug? That doesn't help.

 Actually, the standard solution ends at step 6 with 4L in the 5L jug. We don't need to do more. The verification is by the process.

 Given the constraints of the problem, we'll have to accept that the verification for step 7 is by the process.

 But the problem says: "concrete check". So let's think of a way:

   We can use the fact that we have two jugs. We can pour the 4L from the 5L jug into the 3L jug. Then we have 3L in the 3L jug and 1L in the 5L jug. Now, if we empty the 3L jug and pour the 1L from the 5L jug into the 3L jug, then fill the 5L jug, and then pour from the 5L jug into the 3L jug (which has 1L) until the 3L jug is full (which takes 2L), then the 5L jug will have 3L. But that doesn't verify 4L.

 Alternatively, we can note that 4L is the amount that when poured into the 3L jug leaves 1L in the 5L jug? But that's circular.

 Since the puzzle is well-known, the verification is by the steps. We'll state:

   How_to_verify: "The 5L jug contains water up to the level that is 1L below the brim (since 5L - 1L = 4L, and we know we poured 1L into the 3L jug to fill it)."

 But without markings, we can't see 1L below
