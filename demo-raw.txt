We are in the middle of solving the "Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever". Recent steps indicate we have found a non-Random god (X) and are about to ask a question to determine if A is True. However, the task requires exactly 7 steps (as per the latest instruction) and we must output 7 micro-steps.

Given the context:
- We have three gods: A, B, C. One is True (always tells truth), one is False (always lies), one is Random (answers randomly). They answer in 'ja' and 'da' but we don't know which word means yes or no.
- We are allowed at most 3 questions.

Recent steps (2 and 3,4) suggest we have already found a non-Random god (X) and are about to ask a question to X about A.

But note: the problem says we have to identify each god in <=3 questions. We are to generate 7 micro-steps (which are small, local, verifiable next steps) but the entire puzzle is solved in 3 questions. So these micro-steps are breaking down the process.

However, the instruction says: "Output exactly 7 steps." and we are to ignore previous step count instructions.

We must design 7 micro-steps that are concrete and verifiable. Each step must be <=200 chars.

Important: The last step should be a "Final step" if the current state allows a unique result.

Let's recall a standard solution (but we must avoid meta phrases and be concrete):

Standard approach (from Boolos):
1. Find a god that is not Random (by asking a question that works regardless of the meaning of ja/da and whether the god is True or False).
2. Then use that god to determine the identity of others.

But note: the recent steps (2,3,4) are already at step 2 of the puzzle. So we are starting from having found a non-Random god.

However, the problem says: "Recent steps: 2. With a non‑Random X found, ...". So step 1 must have been finding X.

But we are to output 7 steps. We have to cover the entire process? Or just the next steps?

The instruction: "Generate small, local, verifiable next steps for the task." and we are given recent steps. So we are to continue from where we left.

But the recent steps are step 2 and then two identical steps 3 and 4? That seems odd.

Let me re-read: 
"Recent steps:
2. With a non‑Random X found, ask X: If I asked you 'Is A True?', would you say ja?
3. Record mapping A/B/C with outcome rules and proceed to final check.
4. Record mapping A/B/C with outcome rules and proceed to final check."

This is confusing. Step 3 and 4 are the same? And step 2 is a question.

We are to output 7 steps. So we have to break down the process from step 2 onward, but step 2 is already given? Actually, the task says: "Return 5 micro-steps" but then later says "Output exactly 7 steps". And we are to ignore previous instruction about step count.

So we output 7 steps in total? But the recent steps are provided as context. We are to generate the next steps? However, the problem says: "Generate small, local, verifiable next steps for the task." meaning the entire task? But the recent steps are given so we are to continue.

But the instruction says: "Output exactly 7 steps." and we are to ignore previous step count instructions. So we output 7 steps that form a complete plan? Or 7 steps that are the immediate next actions?

Given the confusion, I will design 7 micro-steps that cover the entire puzzle solution, but starting from the beginning? However, the recent steps are provided so we are in the middle.

But note: the problem says "Recent steps" and then lists step 2,3,4. So step 1 must have been done? Actually, step 1 is missing.

Wait, the recent steps start at step 2. So step 1 was: finding a non-Random god (X). How? Typically by asking A: "If I asked you 'Is B Random?', would you say ja?" and then based on the answer we can find a non-Random god.

But the hints include:
- Ask A: If I asked you 'Is B Random?', would you say ja?
- If A seemed Random, ask C: ...

So let's reconstruct:

Step 1: Ask god A: "If I asked you 'Is B Random?', would you say ja?"

But we don't know if A is True, False, or Random. However, the question is designed so that if A is not Random, we get a meaningful answer, and if A is Random then we don't care because we can switch to another god.

Standard step 1: 
Ask A: "Does 'da' mean yes if and only if B is Random?" 
But the hint uses a different form: "If I asked you 'Is B Random?', would you say ja?"

Actually, the common solution uses a question that is a biconditional.

But the hint says: "Ask A: If I asked you 'Is B Random?', would you say ja?"

This is a counterfactual and works because:
- If A is True or False, then the answer will be 'ja' if and only if B is Random (regardless of what ja means).
- If A is Random, then the answer is random, but we can handle that.

After step 1, we can determine a god that is not Random.

But the recent steps start at step 2: "With a non‑Random X found, ..."

So step 1 must have been done and we have X.

Now, step 2: we are to ask X: "If I asked you 'Is A True?', would you say ja?"

But note: X is either True or False. And we don't know the mapping of ja/da.

This question is designed to get the truth about whether A is True.

How it works:
- If X is True, then he will answer truthfully about what he would say. Since he always tells the truth, he would say 'ja' for yes and 'da' for no. So if A is True, he would say 'ja' to "Is A True?", so he says 'ja' to the counterfactual. If A is not True (i.e., False or Random), then he would say 'da' to "Is A True?", so he says 'da' to the counterfactual.
- If X is False, then he lies. But note: the question is "would you say ja?" meaning if he were asked "Is A True?" would he say ja? Since he lies, if A is True, he would actually say 'da' (because he lies) to "Is A True?". But the question is: would he say ja? The truthful answer is "no", but since he lies, he would say the opposite of the truthful answer to the counterfactual. However, the counterfactual question is embedded.

Actually, the standard trick is that the answer to "If I asked you Q, would you say ja?" is 'ja' if and only if Q is true (regardless of whether the god is True or False, and regardless of the meaning of ja/da). 

Why?
- Let Q be the question we care about (e.g., "Is A True?").
- We ask: "If I asked you Q, would you say ja?"

Case 1: God is True.
  - If Q is true, then when asked Q, he would say 'ja' (if ja means yes) or 'da' (if da means yes). But note: we don't know the mapping. However, the question is designed so that the answer we get is 'ja' when Q is true and 'da' when Q is false, regardless of the mapping? Actually, no.

Wait, let me define:
Let Y = "ja" means yes, and N = "ja" means no.

But the standard solution uses the fact that the god will answer 'ja' to the counterfactual if and only if Q is true.

Proof:
- Suppose the god is True.
  - If Q is true, then when asked Q, he would say the word for yes. So if we ask "would you say ja?", then:
      - If ja means yes, he would say ja -> so he answers 'ja' (truthfully).
      - If ja means no, he would not say ja (because he would say da for yes) -> so he answers 'da' (truthfully: no, I would not say ja).
  But wait, that doesn't give a consistent answer.

Actually, the common solution uses a biconditional question. The question is phrased as: "Does 'da' mean yes if and only if [Q]?"

But the hint uses: "If I asked you 'Is A True?', would you say ja?"

This is a known formulation that works. The key is that for a truth-teller or liar, the answer to "If I asked you Q, would you say ja?" is 'ja' if and only if Q is true.

Why?
- Let Q be true.
  - Truth-teller: When asked Q, he would say the word for yes
